# Anomaly Detection
## Overview
Welcome to the repository dedicated to exploring different methods of Anomaly Detection. This repository serves as a centralized hub for various work, research, and resources related to Anomaly Detection.

## About
Anomaly detection is a technique used in data mining and machine learning to identify patterns that do not conform to expected behavior, called anomalies, outliers, or novelties. The goal is to find data points significantly different from most of the data. Anomalies could indicate critical incidents such as fraud, network intrusions, medical problems, or structural defects.

## Techniques
Some of the  techniques for detecting anomalies are given below:
#### 1. Statistical Tests(e.g Z-score)
#### 2. Probabilistic Methods
#### 3. Machine Learning Methods(e.g. KNN, OneClassSVM, PCA, Isolation Forest, etc)
#### 4. Deep Learning Methods(e.g. Autoencoder)
#### 5. Ensemble Methods
#### 6. Many More
